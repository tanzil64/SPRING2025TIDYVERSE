Chess Player Transfers to the U.S.: A Tidyverse Analysis
In this project, I analyzed a dataset containing count data on chess players transferring their federation to the United States. 
The goal was to visualize transfer trends over time, identify the most active federations, and highlight how transfers from less frequent federations contribute to the overall picture.

Data Preparation:Using the tidyverse package in R, I cleaned and transformed the dataset to make it suitable for analysis:

Removed missing or irrelevant data;Grouped transfers by year and original federation:
Created a new category called "Other" to group less frequent federations for simplified visualization

Visualization:To explore the data, I used ggplot2 to create the following visualizations:
